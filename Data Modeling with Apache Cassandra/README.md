### Purpose

  In this notebook I learn the basics of creating and using an Apache Cassandra Keyspace.
  
#### Summary
The key understandings that I gained from this exercise were cluster, session, and keyspace creation, and 
"query-first" table design.  The notebook runs through creating tables from a .csv file and querying them 
to check the results to make sure they are as expected.
