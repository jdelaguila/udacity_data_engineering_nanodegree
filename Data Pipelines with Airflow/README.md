## Project Summary

In this project a fictitious music streaming company wants to automate their data pipeline
with Apache Airflow.  

Much of this project was already completed with imports and templates. The details of the dags 
and operators needed to be filled in.  I feel that I didn't gain too much from this project because
of the surface level nature, and conjecture that to deeply understand automating data pipelines 
with Airflow could be an entire course on its own.
